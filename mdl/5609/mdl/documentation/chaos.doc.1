This file documents the CHAOS package found in MDLLIB, written by PDL
Documentation by Steve Barber, and it is not necessarily accurate.

This package was written to implement a mail system, so the functions
lean heavily towards this service of the Chaosnet.

Additional documentation on the Chaosnet, its protocols, and how to
use it with 10s, 20s, ITS, LispMachines, or VAXes is contained in AI
Memo 628, "Chaosnet", by David A. Moon.  It assumes familiarity with
the machines at assembly language level (sometimes even lower!).

------------

Use of the package:
===================

Get a MDL and type <USE "CHAOS">.  You now have all the following
functions at your command.

Functions and how to use them:
==============================

<CHAOS-OPEN string "OPT" fix>

opens a Chaosnet connection

returns: either a fix representing the JFN for the  open connection or
         a false with an error message inside of it.

args:  string --  this is a string in TOPS20 filename format. Only the
                  first and second name attributes are significant.
                  The string is of the form 'hostname'.'service'.

                  The hostname is something like AI, or CADR-11 or
                  any other recognized Chaos host.

                  'Service' represents the high-level protocol used by
                  the net to handle your transaction and is something
                  like MAIL, TELNET, DOVER, FINGER, TIME, etc.  See
                  [MOON] for details and options.


        fix --    this represents 'wait-time' and defaults to *7000*.
                  I'm not quite sure what this is used for.


<CHAOS-OUT info jfn:fix "OPT" count:fix>

outputs 'info' to the net

returns: <OR FIX FALSE>
         if its a fix, its the JFN
         if its a false, it indicates an error

args:    info -- can be either a string or a <PRIMTYPE WORD>
         jfn --  the number returned by CHAOS-OPEN for this connection
         count -- number of characters to be output. Default (I think)
                  is the number of chars in the string.


<CHAOS-RESP string fix>

reads Chaos buffer into 'string' using the 'fix' as a JFN.

returns: fix representing God-knows-what, or a false with the error.


<CHAOS-OPER jfn function-code>

does a Chaosnet operation using the MTOPR jsys.

returns:  fix - the JFN (why?), or the usual error message

args:     jfn - a fix
          function-code  -- a fix indicating what operation is
                            to be performed.  See [MOON] and DEC
                            monitor calls manual for more info.


<CHAOS-CLOSE jfn>

closes the channel represented by the JFN and returns the jfn.




Notes:  These functions do not constitute a general Chaosnet
interface. Status codes can not be returned, nor can the operation
codes.  Also, reading is not general enough either.
