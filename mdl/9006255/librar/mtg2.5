LIBRARY COMMITTEE MEETING, II

     The Library Committee held its second meeting in Professor 
Michael Dertouzos' office, room 105, on April 23, 1982. Present were, 
Tim Anderson, Ramesh Patil, Julliette Sutherland, Gerard Vichniak, 
John Hynes, Maria Sensale and Gloria Stafford.

     John distributed a brief description of the Reading Room expenses 
for the calendar year 1981, adding that this year's expenses will 
be about $10,000 higher. He reported that Michael would like the 
committee to prepare a comprehensive list of proposed Reading Room
projects which he would then review for possible funding. Michael
is planning to attend one of the Committee meetings in the near future.

     John also reported that in response to his request for
recommendations of Faculty who might serve on the Committee, Michael
had suggested Professor Licklider and Professor Fano.

     John requested that the committee attend the next meeting pre-
pared with concrete suggestions and broad ranging proposals for the
future of the Reading Room. He also referred to several topics 
considered at the last meeting, specifically, automating the Reading 
Room, and the idea of an on-line file of keywords which would 
direct attention to special interests, eliminating the need to 
conduct subject-heading searches.

     Maria distributed a list of exchanges and journals to which the 
Reading Room subscribes. She called attention to the lists and asked 
for some feedback from the committee about the possibility of cancel-
lations or additions.

     She indicated that the March Bulletin reflects some of the sug-
gestions from the last meeting. It includes xeroxed copies of the indices  
of current proceedings as well as an announcement of the Reading Room's
subscription to the Boston Globe and the New York Times. A file was
also set up on DM for keyword search of newly catalogued material.

     Maria noted the response to the Bulletin has been very favorable.
Individuals have been seen browsing with a copy in their hands, and
several secretaries have approached the Reading Room Staff inquiring
about certain entries which they had been requested to locate.

     Gloria and Maria have been attempting to recruit graduate students. 
One in particular, appears to be enthusiastic and has indicated he will
attend the next meeting. He is interested in the area of information 
retrieval.

     Maria reported subscriptions have been initiated for the
American Association for Artificial Intelligence and the International 
Journal of Robotics Research. 

    Currently, the Reading Room is implementing a system for 
gathering statistics to determine the identity and number of
users.
    The Committee discussed: 
    -the merits of an on-line circulation system.
    -the implications of the Privacy Act relative to the Reading Room.
    -the value of subscribing to multiple copies of journals.
    -the problem of overdues.
    -future space requirements.
    -the location of an additional copier, and the pros and cons of 
one that is coin-operated.
    -the need for an all-out shelf reading for more efficiency in
handling the collection.

    John identified two types of committees which should result
from this one organizational group. A Projects Committee which would
address the issue of automation, and an Operations Committee, which 
would contribute assistance with policies and technical information.

    The Committee agreed the latter part of the week is not good
for meetings. It was decided the next meeting would probably be
on a Tuesday at lunchtime. A training program for Support Staff 
and students on the use of the Reading Room was also discussed.
