1LIBRARY COMMITTEE MEETING                   March 23, 1982



    0Present at the first library committee meeting were John Hynes,
Harold Goldberger, Tim Anderson, Ramesh Patil, Gerard Vichniak, Mike
Brady, Chuck Rich and Library Assistants, Maria Sensale and Gloria
Stafford.

    John Hynes gave a brief introductory statement outlining the
purpose for organizing the committee, that being, the future of the
Reading Room.

    Maria spoke on the issues the committee will be 
asked to address, such as an on-line catalogue and the
Reading Room hours.

    Harold outlined areas of concern which the committee
should consider:
    -Should the Reading Room function as a research library or
become active in interlibrary loans, (a Reading Room vs. a
library)?
    -Should the collection be integrated with the MIT library
system?
    -Should keys be distributed to faculty, research assistants
and students?
    -Should the Reading Room be computerized and if so, to what
extent?
    
    Mike elaborated on his ideal of the function of the Reading
Room. The goal should be to attract and accomodate the community
with the latest materials available in the computer science 
field, thus discouraging the need to seek elsewhere, such as
Barker Engineering Library. The priorities should be journals
and periodicals, with emphasis on the present and last year,
and technical reports. Books, he noted, are of least importance.

    Chuck commented the two goals he feels important are quick
and easy access to the most current information and materials, 
and the other, which may not be major, is archival.

    Maria described two types of patrons, those involved in research,
and reference questions from outside sources. She requested each
committee member survey their individual groups to determine needs
which can be fulfilled by the Reading Room. It is also important to
decide, for purposes of budget and space, which materials should be
exchanged, eliminated, maintained and/or acquired.

    It was noted that eventually the committee can help determine the
budget as well as assist with technical advice. John emphasized that
Michael Dertouzos is concerned and wants the Reading Room to meet the
perceived needs of the users in both AI and LCS.

    Harold suggested two committees might better address the
issues. One could make suggestions regarding the collection
while the other would consider innovations.

    Tim observed it might be very challenging to experiment
with a library program as opposed to duplicating the methods
of others.

    Ideally, Mike noted, he would like a system that could tell
him what's new in his particular field of interest, possibly
by employing key words.

    Other topics included:
    -Resuming the newspaper subscriptions.
    -Training the library staff to use electronic correspondence,
including an on-line suggestion directory.
    -Employment of a full time grad student to create programs
geared for library functions.
    -The need to broaden the scope of the committee by inviting
representation from additional groups.
    -The need for some manner of security.
    -Photocopying and circulating the indeces from current journals.
    -Serving the needs of those in the forefront of research, 
especially students or those on a basic level.

    John will prepare a statement outlining the amount of money which
is spent for books versus periodicals for the next meeting.  The
committee agreed to meet about once a month until some policies are
established, and thereafter, several times a year, or as necessary.
