This file contains helpful hints in the area of making, patching,
maintaining, and otherwise dealing with the MUDDLE interpreter.

Reeve)

---------------I. Making a MUDDLE.-----------------------------------

How to create a new MUDDLE.  This section may be somewhat out of date.

1 [ITS].  If this MUDDLE is for ITS, print the file

		MUDSYS;MUD STINK

If any of the files specified have not been created since their corres-
ponding source files were last modified, reassemble them.

1 [Tenex].  If this MUDDLE is for TENEX, do the above step using the file

		MUDSYS;TNX STINK

2.  To reassemble any module, get a MIDAS (the special version kept on
the MUDSYS; directory).  Type:

		MUDSYS;_MUDSYS;<-module name>-	; (to MIDAS)

Some modules, which differ in their Tenex/TOPS-20 and ITS versions, must
be assembled twice, once for ITS and once for Tenex/TOPS-20.  The
convention is to assemble the Tenex version to a file named

		T.<module> BIN

where <module> is what you would normally call the ITS version.  As it
happens, there are links in MUDSYS that allow you to do this
automatically:

		MUDSYS;_MUDSYS;T.INTERR

for example.  There are about ten modules that have separate Tenex
versions.

3.  Make sure you are running under DDT.  Get a STINK (the special
version on the MUDSYS; directory).  Type:

		MMUDSYS;MUD STINK@		; (to STINK)
	     or MMUDSYS;TNX STINK@

Eventually STINK will type out a symbol table.  Check for any undefined
globals (symbols printed out indented 1 space). Type:

		TD				; (to STINK)

and wait.

4.  You are now back in DDT.  Type a rubout and wait for DDT to respond
with "??".  DDT is now ready.

5 [ITS]. If this MUDDLE is for ITS, type:

		:XFILE MUDSYS;SYMBOL CLEANR	; (to DDT)

5 [Tenex]. If this MUDDLE is for TENEX, type:

		:XFILE MUDSYS;TNX SYMBOL	; (to DDT)

6.  If this is going to be a real new version of MUDDLE (i.e., you are
ready to install this as NMUDDLE, and are finished debugging), type:

		VCREATG			; (to DDT)

to create a new version number.

7 [ITS].  If this MUDDLE is for ITS, type

		:PDUMP MUDSAV;TS MUD		; (to DDT)

then

		G				; (to DDT)

MUDDLE will type 

		MUDDLE INITIALIZATION.

and eventually it will cause DDT to type a *

7 [Tenex].  If this MUDDLE is for TENEX, dump out the current core image using
Y in DDT.  Kill the job.  Get a MUDDLE and type 

		<FLOAD "CLR;ITSNX NBIN">	; (to MUDDLE)

Invoke

		<ITSEX <-name of dump file>->	; (to MUDDLE)

ITSEX will return a closed CHANNEL when it is done.  Two new files now
exist, they both have the same name as the original dump file with the
second name of one SAV and the other SYMBOL. These will be referred to
as the SAV file and the SYMBOL file from now on.

Go to ISI (or some other accessible Tenex/TOPS-20 site) via telnet.  Log
in and get an FTP.  Type

		CON(tenex completes) DMS	; (to FTP)

Type

		GET(tenex completes) <-SAV file>-
		<-local file name>-		; (to FTP)

after TENEX says the transfer has completed.

Do the GET for the SYMBOL file.  Now get an IDDT. Type

		L<-sav file>-		; (to IDDT)
	    and ;O<-symbol file>-

Now type

		SETUPG				; (to IDDT)

MUDDLE will type

		MUDDLE INITIALIZATION

and eventually return to IDDT via a JRST 4,.

8 [ITS].  Depending on whether new bugs are suspected or not, it may be
wise to dump the MUDDLE at this point.

		:PDUMP TS MUDDLE		; (to DDT)

You probably want to dump it to your directory?

8 [Tenex].  To dump a Tenex MUDDLE, type (to IDDT)

		;U MDL105.EXE

(for example) which will write out a pure save file.

9.  Type G and MUDDLE will respond

		MUDDLE <-version>- IN OPERATION

etc.

10 [ITS].  To get PPRINT, EDIT, etc. loaded, type

		<FLOAD "MUDSYS;NEWMUD">	; (to MUDDLE)

After :INPOPping, your new MUDDLE may be dumped and tested.


----------II. Patching MUDDLE----------------------------------------

0. Get permission from someone who knows what they are doing.

1. Get a fresh copy of the MUDDLE you are patching.

		JJ				; (to DDT)

		L SYS1;TS MUDnm		; (to DDT)

2. Make your patches.  MUDDLE has a PATCH space defined, so the DDT
patch commands will work reasonably.  (If the previous sentence is at
all mysterious, this is a good time to stop and think twice before
proceding).

3. Dump out the world.

		:PDUMP SYS1;TS MUDnm		; (to DDT)

(or whereever:  at this writing the interpreter actually lives in
MUDSAV;)


-------------III.  Patching a Running MUDDLE.--------------------------

This process is known as "desecration" (Thanks, NDR).  It allows a
user to make the pure part of his core image become the pure part
of a MUDDLE's core image.

0.  Think twice, ask someone who knows what they are doing.

1.  Get the Desecration program.

		<FLOAD "MUDSYS;CRATE">

2.  Desecrate the MUDDLE.

		<DESECRATE "name">

Where "name" is a string giving the file to desecrate  (defaults if not
given to "MUDDLE").  The pure part of the PDUMPed file

		DSK:SYS;TS name

is changed to be the same as the corresponding pages of your core image.
Thus, changes to the pure pages of your MUDDLE will propagate to other
users and to the file.

3.  Make your patch.  Note that this method of patching does not change
the symbol table of the file.  Consequently, there is only a limited
range of patches that can be put in in this way.
