MUDMAN;DSK:GLUE RECENT

MONDAY  MARCH 28,1977  06:33:09

For those of you who do not know already, use the GLUE program
to do your gluing for you (easiest way is GLUE^K).  It will ask
questions much as COMBAT does, and is relatively tasteful.


June 2,1976

	Several changes have been made to GROUP-GLUE.  GROUP-GLUE will now be able to
flush internal entries from groups and packages.  This is done via PACKAGE and
SURVIVOR modes similar to that in the compiler.

	There are two advantages to flushing internal entries.  The group is made
smaller since internal entries will not have RSUBR-ENTRY's associated with them.  Also
the code for the group is reduced.  In general only the ENTRY's need to be kept for a
PACKAGE.  This can be done by specifying the package using PACKAGE mode. SURVIVOR mode
should be used if the user wishes to explicitly state which entries are to be kept.

	To use GROUP-GLUE  do a <USE "GLUE"> and then GROUP-LOAD the group you wish to
glue. The call to GROUP-GLUE is as follows:

	<GROUP-GLUE <-group-> <-substitute-> <-output channel-> <-package-> <-survivors-> >

where the first argument is the group you wish to glue.  If the second argument,
"substitute", is provided and is non-false than a MUDDLE SUBSTITUTE is done to 
reflect the changes in the group in the MUDDLE.  This is useful when interrupt handlers
or PRINTTYPES are used.  If a third argument is given and is non-false  information
about the state of the gluing will be printed.  The third argument should be the
CHANNEL to print this information on.  

	If the fourth argument, "package", is provided and is non-false then PACKAGE
mode will be used.  This argument should be a string specifying the package that is
being glued.  In PACKAGE mode only the ENTRY's will be preserved and all internal
entries will be flushed.  This option can also be used by setting the ATOM PKG to the
name of the package.

	If the fifth argument, "survivors", is provided the SURVIVOR mode will be used.
This argument should be a list of those entries to be preserved.  All other
entries will be flushed. This option overrides PACKAGE mode.  This option can also be
used by setting the ATOM SURV to the list of entries being preserved.
