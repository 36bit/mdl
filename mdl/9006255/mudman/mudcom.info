MUDCOM --

	MUDCOM is a MUDDLE source file comparison program which allows
the user to detect functions, etc. which have been changed between two
version.  MUDCOM is not interactive; all instructions must be passed
on the JCL line.  
	
	MUDCOM understands the following MUDDLE structures at top level:
	      FUNCTIONs    -  <DEFINE FOO .....>
	      MACROs	   -  <DEFMAC BAR .....>
	      GVALs	   -  <SETG MUMBLE ....>
	      LVALs	   -  <SET MUMBLE .....>
	      MANIFEST
	      PACKAGE
	      ENTRY
	      ENDPACKAG
	      MSETG	   -  <MSETG FOO 1> = <SETG FOO 1> <MANIFEST FOO>

	The JCL to MUDCOM in the simplest case is <filename1>,<filename2>.
MUDCOM will compare the two files and print out information concerning
those structures it undestands which have been removed, changed, or
inserted.
	
	MUDCOM has a number of switches which can be set.  They are
given as /X, where X is the name of the switch.  Currently the following
switches are useful:

	T	- print totals at the end of the comparison
	C 	- check the file given for syntax (only one file name)
	M	- check the files for changed MACROs and MANIFESTs
		  In this mode, MUDCOM will make a second pass through
		  the first file given in the JCL, looking for all
		  occurances of calls to changed MACROs and MANIFESTs.
		  MUDCOM will consider functions making such calls as
		  having been 'changed' and will tell which MACRO or
		  MANIFEST caused the 'change'.
		
	The following other JCL is understood my MUDCOM:

	(<atom1> <atom2> <atom3>)
	          appearing before the file names in the JCL will cause
		  MUDCOM to thing that functions calling those atoms
		  have been changed and will print them as such.

	"filename"
		  appearing anywhere in the JCL causes JCL to be read
		  from that file until EOF is reached.

	{filename filename filename}
		  is used to specify files to search in calls to MUDFND
		  (see below)

	Links to MUDCOM

	1. MUDCHK	-- :MUDCHK filename <cr>
	   	  checks a file for MUDDLE syntax errors.  This is
		  the same as :MUDCOM /C filename <cr>

	2. MUDLST	-- :MUDLST filename <cr>
		  lists all FUNCTIONs and GVALs found in the file.
		  This is the same as :MUDCOM /L filename <cr>

	3. MUDFND	-- :MUDFND <atom> <atom> ... {file file} <cr>
		  searches {files} for FUNCTIONs/GVALs called <atom>s.
		  Can be used for finding a function in a haystack.
		  This is the same as :MUDCOM (<atom> <atom>) {file file}.
		  Since this can be tedious, it is easier to use the
		  "filename" convention and have a disk file containing
		  the files to be searched (surrounded by {}s).
		  Thus, :MUDFND FOO BAR BLETCH "MARC;ZORK FILES" <cr>
		    will look for the typical function names in the
		    files specified by MARC;ZORK FILES.
