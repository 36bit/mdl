ITIME Package					pdl 7/2/79

     ITIME is a package for representing dates and times in Muddle
space- and manipulation- efficiently.  A daytime (sans time-zone) is
represented as a FIX, and with time-zone as a UVECTOR of two FIXes.

     This package is intended to replace the older "TIMFCN" package as a
standard for representing and manipulating dates and times.

     A daytime consists of a fix in which the right half is a
"fractional" time and the left is the number of days since some
arbitrary past date. The standard chosen is that described in the
TOPS-20 Monitor Calls Manual, section 2.8.2.

     The advantage of this standard is that manipulation of it need not
take into account any of the details (leap-years, daylight savings time,
etc.) of time representation other than at conversion to or from the
more conventional representation.  For example, the number 262144
represents one day (CHTYPE it to a WORD to see why).  Therefore, noon of
any day is </ 262144 2>, since noon is the middle of the day.
Unfortunately, one hour is 10922 2/3 time units, so really fussy
manipulations must compensate for the fractional units, but since one
unit is about 1/3 of a second, you have to be pretty fussy to care.

     To add or subtract numbers of days, just add or subtract that
number times 262144, which represents one day.

     There are several entries:

ITIME { qtime:fix }

With no arguments, returns the current daytime in internal format.  If
an argument is given, it is a time in ITS internal format (which is of
course, different):  its internal format will be returned.

LTIME { itime:fix-or-uvector } { time-list:list }

Converts "internal" daytime format into "external" daytime format.
External format is a Muddle list:
		((yy mm dd) (hh mm ss) "zone")
This format is obviously more convenient for certain operations
(printing the daytime, for example) than the internal format.

Both arguments are optional.  The second defaults to an internal (and
reused!) daytime list.  The first defaults to the current daytime as
returned by ITIME.  Note that LTIME will accept daytimes in "uvector"
format:  that is, with a zone attached.

BTIME { yy:fix mm:fix dd:fix hh:fix mm:fix ss:fix }

Returns the internal daytime specified by its arguments.  All are
optional.

IDAY { itime:fix }

Returns the day of the week of the daytime given, as a FIX:  0 = Sunday,
1 = Monday, etc.  The argument is optional, by default the current
daytime.

ZONE { zone:fix-or-string }

Converts internal zone format to external and vice versa.  If given no
argument, returns the external format for the local time zone (assumed
to be Eastern).  T  Tzone tables are reproduced below:

        "EST" 5  "EDT" *1000005*
	"CST" 6  "CDT" *1000006*
	"MST" 7  "MDT" *1000007*
	"PST" 8  "PDT" *1000010*
	"YST" 9  "YDT" *1000011*
	"HST" 10 "HDT" *1000012*
	"BST" 11 "BDT" *1000013*
	"AST" 4  "ADT" *1000004*
	"NST" 3
	"GMT" 0

As you can see from the tables, the zone which represents the "Summer
time" is the FIX produced by turning on the lowest bit of the left half
in a FIX of the basic zone.  E.g.; EST and EDT have the same right half.

QTIME itime:fix

Converts the right half (the time) if a daytime into ITS internal format.
