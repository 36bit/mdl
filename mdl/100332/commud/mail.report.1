There have been two main areas of attack in the Advanced Message System
and Planning System over the last six months.  First has been upgrading
the Reader and Composer of the message system to have multi-media
capabilities.  Second has been the implementation of an advanced spread
sheet simulator for use by planners.

The Reader and Composer can now deal with multi-media text as defined in
RFC759, RFC767, etc.  Text elements of consisting of media other than
normal text are logically inserted into the message by the user typing
(for example) "Insert Fax <PDL>FOO.FAX".  Because we are still hampered
by the lack of multi-media capability in our terminals (VT100s, for the
most part), the media are not displayed.  Instead a token is placed in
the text field which indicates the presence of non-text media.  This
token may be edited as though it were part of the text the user typed.

When a message is received in multi-media form, the analogous process
is carried out to display it; the Reader gives the user as much
information as it can (usually just the medium and the origin of the
"unpresentable" medium).  The presentation is modular, so that when
multi-media capable terminals appear, it will be possible to upgrade the
presentation with little trouble.

A spread sheet simulator has been written which builds on the ground
cleared by VisiCalc.  The goal has been to produce a multi-sheet,
multi-user, data-based planning aid.  Some of the capabilities which
have been added include

  - the ability to reference entries in different spread sheets
    than the current one.

  - a better command parser which determines heuristically whether a
    string entry or an expression entry was intended.

  - the ability for users to define their own operations.

  - "area" operations (as opposed to "range" and "entry" operations).

  - complete freedom of use of forward and circular references.

  - variable column sizes on a per-column basis.

  - named entries, ranges, etc.

  - automatic loading of referenced spread sheets.

  - form definition and form-filling commands.

  - references ("A2('B1)" refers to the entry at the A2 position relative
    to B1.  "A2(B1)" refers to the entry at that position relative to
    the coordinate contained in B1).  This capability allows general
    data-based queries to be implemented.

  - string operations (finding matches, prefixes, and substrings).
