   The MEDIT package implements an interface between MDL and EMACS.  It
allows the user invoke an EMACS inferior to his MDL and to only
re-load the functions that have been edited, rather than the whole
file.  Needless to say, this capability is really nice to have when
the load average is high.

  To get into EMACS from MDL, do <MEDIT>$.  MEDIT will clear the
screen, type "MEDIT==>" and go into EMACS.  The EMACS invoked will be
in MEDIT mode (note the name in the lower left hand corner!).  The
only difference between MEDIT-Emacs and regular EMACS is that there
are two additional functions defined.  They are as follows:

               M-z,M-Z: marks the current DEFINE, or the immediately 
                        following DEFINE.

               ^X Z:    exit from MEDIT.  Saves the marked functions
                        and offers to save all changed buffers.  If
                        EMACS is exited with ^X ^Z like normal, it
                        will NOT save anything, and you will have
                        gained nothing.

As soon as ^X Z is finished, MEDIT returns to MDL and loads in the
edited functions, if there are any.  It will type a message to this
effect.

Remember that since the EMACS is inferior to the MDL, it is not the
same as any EMACS that may have been invoked from EXEC.  It will be
empty when it is created.  However, successive invocations of MEDIT
will always get the same EMACS; i.e, it will be just as it was left,
with all buffers intact.
