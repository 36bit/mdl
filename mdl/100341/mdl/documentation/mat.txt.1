         MAT: A Cross Referencing Program for MDL
                                    12/81 - shane

MAT (Muddle ATsign) is a program for generating a cross-reference listing
and symbol table(s) for one or more files of MDL code. Each atom used
as a global symbol in tthe input file(s) (GVAL, FUNCTION, NEWTYPE, or
MACRO) will appear in the cross-reference listing and symbol-table.

To use MAT, get a MDL and type <USE "MAT">. The sole entry to the
package is named, strangely enough, MAT. Some improvement in runtime
may be gained by also typing <GC 0 <> 50> or some such, before calling
MAT: this directs the interpreter to use the marksweep garbage collecter
rather than the more exhaustive (and slower) copying garbage collector.

The general form of a call to MAT is:

        <MAT specstring:string  "OPT" symtablesize:fix>

symtablesize is an optional fix controlling the initial size of
the symbol table used by MAT. MAT can grow the symbol table, if
necessary, but growing involves copying and, possibly, a garbage 
collection. The size is 1000 by default. For large runs, you might
consider giving MAT a second argument.


specstring is a string of the form: "Fn1,Fn2,.../switches".
Any number of filenames, separated by commas, may precede the first switch
(if any). In fact, it is not necessary to explicitly list each file in the
call to MAT (see /I switch below). Regardless of how they are entered, all
files will be cross-referenced as a group.


SWITCHES:
 
/C      Generate a cross-reference. The default is no cross reference.


/U      Print a separate symbol table for each type of object in each
        file (ie, one table for GVALs, one for TYPEs, etc.).


/P[width length]    Set page width and length. The defaults are 90
                    and 60 respectively.


/I[title1 title2]   Sets Fn1 and Fn2 of the output file; defaults are
                    the input file's first name (title1) and MAT (title2).


/N       Print the symbol table only (and cross-reference listing
         if requested). MAT defaultly prints a record file containing
         a title page, index, and numbered pages and lines for each file.


/S       If given a group of files and this switch is selected, a
         record file will be printed for each input file. If /S is not 
         selected, only one record file (containing the text of each input
         file) will be written out.


/I[Filename]       MAT will look up input filenames from a file, if this switch
                   is selected. The input filenames must be separated by
                   commas or carriage returns.


/Q[message]        MAT will print a message at the bottom of each page.
        

SUBTITLES:

You may include subtitles in your file. Subtitles are strings of the form:

                      "Subtitle subtitle_text"

A subtitle begins with the word subtitle (or Subtitle or SUBTITLE) followed
by the text of the subtitle (the number of characters should not exceed
page width). Subtitles will be printed at the top of each page. If a record
file is printed, it will contain an index of subtitles and page numbers.
Page delimiters are ^L's which you include in your file.
