TS FSCAN is a Muddle program that scans files and finds all ATOMs
which are not inside the ROOT oblist. It then prints out the ATOMs
in alphabetical order. It is mainly used for quick checkings of
possible misspelling of ATOM names.

It can be used in 2 ways:

[1] With JCL

    :FSCAN <-out1>-_<-in>-, <-out2>-_<-in2>-, <-out3>-_<-in3>-, ... <CR>

<-out>'s- and <-in>-'s should be standard ITS file specifications. As usual,
^Q can be used to quote back-arrows and commas [Note 1]. <-out>-'s and
back-arrows are optional. If missing, the output files will be defaulted
to TTY:.

[2] Without JCL

    :FSCAN <CR>

This gets a Muddle loaded with the FSCAN routines. The function to do 
file-scanning is called FILE-SCAN.

    <FILE-SCAN <-infile>- "OPTIONAL" (<-obs>- ()) (<-option>- 1) (<-outchan>- .OUTCHAN)>

Where
    <-infile>- should be a file specification string;
    <-obs>- should be a list of OBLISTs, or an OBLIST. ATOMs in <-obs>- are
        ignored in file scanning;
    <-option>- should be either 1, 2, or 3;
    <-outchan>- should be an output CHANNEL.

In Option 1, FILE-SCAN uses a READ-TABLE to turn off !-,!",%,#,(,),[,],<,>,
{,},',. and comma so that no new types or garbages are generated. This is
the standard option, and invoking FSCAN with JCL will use this option.

Option 2 turns off !-,#,%; changes {}'s to ()'s (to avoid building templates);
but retains all others. This way structures will be built and would be slower
than Option 1. One would want to use Option 2 if one wants to check balance of
parentheses and brackets as well.

In Option 3, everything is turned of except letters (A-Z,a-z) and numerals (0-9).
It can be used to check files containing mainly English words.
    
------------

[Note 1] To quote semi-colons, colons and spaces, one needs to use 2 (TWO___) ^Q's.
The first ^Q is processed by the JCL-parser, and the second ^Q is processed by
the Muddle file name parser (in OPEN). Also the Muddle file name parser has some
known shortcomings.

[Note 2] TS FSCAN does NOT___ contain any of the preloaded rsubrs, which are not
normally needed in this application. Nevertheless the ROOT oblist contains all
the ATOMs found in ROOT of a normal Muddle. Ie, ATOMs like USE, PACKAGE, EDIT,
GROUP-LOAD, PPRINT and others would be there even tough these rsubrs are not
loaded.
