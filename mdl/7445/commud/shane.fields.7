I.MAILBOX FORMAT
    
     mailbox := (uname) | (uname host) | (uname host port)
	        | (uname host port person) | (uname host port person extra)

     uname   := STRING

     host    := STRING | FALSE

     port    := STRING | FIX | FALSE

     person  := STRING | FALSE

     extra   := (name value name value ...)

     name    := STRING

     value   := ANY

A mailbox is a LIST which contains at least one element. The MDL decl pattern
for a mailbox is:

        <LIST STRING [OPT <OR STRING FALSE>
                          <OR STRING FALSE>
                          <OR STRING FALSE>
                          <LIST [REST STRING ANY]>]>

II. BODY FORMAT

	body := structure

	structure := medium | multiple_media

	multiple-media := [presentation_mode (structure structure ... )]

	medium := text | notes | enclosures | exotic 

	text := (STRING STRING ... )

	exotic := [media_name (format ANY ... "RFC767" source ... format ANY)]

	format := STRING

	media_name := "FAX" | "IMAGE" | "VOICE" | "GRAPHICS"

	file := CHANNEL | STRING

	source := STRING | CHANNEL | UVECTOR | BYTES

	presentation-mode := "INDEPENDENT" | "SEQUENTIAL" | "SIMULTANEOUS"
                             | "BRANCH" | FALSE

III. DOCUMENT FORMAT

	message := [name value name value ...]

	name := STRING

	value := ANY
